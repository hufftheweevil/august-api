# August Endpoints

This is an updated version of [Nolan Brown's list](https://nolanbrown.medium.com/august-lock-rest-apis-the-basics-7ec7f31e7874). Endpoints without a status indicate I am unable to test at this time. Known keys are listed for POST and PUT endpoints that require data. If you have any information to add to this list, please post a GitHub issue or PR.

**Note:** Not all endpoints are implemented in this package. Some may be added in the future. This list is for information and research.

All endpoints found at:
- Brand.AUGUST: "https://api-production.august.com"
- Brand.YALE_ACCESS: "https://api-production.august.com"
- Brand.YALE_HOME: "https://api.aaecosystem.com"
